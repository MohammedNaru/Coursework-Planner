## 📅 Planning and managing your work

All the coursework is listed as issues on this repo. These issues are mirrored on your curriculum backlog page.

You will copy these issues to your Coursework Planner, which is one repo that will hold all your coursework and assignments for the entire course.

If you do not already have your own Coursework Planner, set one up now:
